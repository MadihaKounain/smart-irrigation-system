# 🌿 Smart Irrigation System (Streamlit + ML)

This project simulates and predicts irrigation needs based on environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) using a machine learning model in an interactive Streamlit app.

## 🔍 Features
- Simulated sensor data
- ML prediction using Random Forest
- Interactive Streamlit UI
- CSV prediction log
- Data filtering and visualization
- Model performance report

## 🧠 ML Model
- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Inputs: Temp, Humidity, Soil
- Output: Binary (Irrigation Needed or Not)

## 🛠️ How to Use
```bash
python simulate_data.py
python train_model.py
streamlit run app.py
```
